# about

This is my [website](ederekun.github.io) being built from scratch as a hobby for learning and also a part of my portfolio. 

The following packages are currently being used for this website:

- Bootstrap

# the future

My future plans for this website:

- JSON-ify the contents of the website to be generated through JavaScript.
- Introduce jQuery then React (and maybe other more front-end frameworks).
- Host the website on an actual web server with its own domain named ederevx.dev.
- Implement back-end methods/frameworks for allowing the website to do cool stuff involving big data and also host files for my projects such as Android kernels and ROMs.
